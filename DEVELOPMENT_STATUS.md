# Hey Nova - Development Status

## Current Status: MVP Complete

The Hey Nova personal assistant MVP is now fully functional with the following features:

### Core Features
- **Wake Word Detection**: Responds to "Hey Nova" using Picovoice Porcupine
- **Speech Recognition**: Accurate transcription using Whisper small model with VAD
- **Natural Conversation**: Dynamic speech detection with state machine and hysteresis
- **Command Routing**: Skills-first with LLM fallback architecture
- **Voice Output**: High-quality British female voice (Azure Libby) with fallback to macOS
- **Personalization**: Addresses user as "Sir" and knows personal context
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time LLM and TTS for natural conversation flow

### Technical Achievements
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Robust VAD state machine with preroll/postroll buffers
- **Audio Pipeline**: Stable frame buffering with consistent sample rates
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks throughout the pipeline
- **Observability**: Structured logging with audio traces and metrics
- **Testing**: Regression tests for core components

## Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Conversation Enhancement
- [ ] Full barge-in support (interrupt Nova mid-sentence)
- [ ] Streaming STT for real-time transcription
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation memory
- [ ] Enhanced prosody and emotion in TTS

### Phase 2: Skills Expansion
- [ ] Dynamic skill discovery and loading
- [ ] Notion deep integration
- [ ] Calendar and email integration
- [ ] Enhanced system control

### Phase 3: Cross-Device Support
- [ ] API-first architecture with FastAPI
- [ ] Mobile companion app
- [ ] Shared memory across devices
- [ ] Secure credential management

### Phase 4: Proactive Intelligence
- [ ] Context-aware notifications
- [ ] User habit learning
- [ ] Predictive suggestions
- [ ] Automated workflows

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- The app control skill currently doesn't work in the terminal environment
- Conversation flow could be improved with better turn-taking
- Short utterance handling could be refined for better accuracy
- Wake word is still required after a timeout in conversation mode

## Next Steps
1. Implement full barge-in support for interrupting Nova
2. Create a menubar app for persistent access
3. Expand skill library for more useful commands
4. Improve conversation memory for more natural interactions
