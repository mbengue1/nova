feat(interruption): Implement continuous speech capture during interruptions

- Add continuous audio capture from first energy spike detection
- Improve speech pattern validation to distinguish speech from noise
- Add pre-buffer to capture speech before interruption is confirmed
- Fix issues with consecutive interruptions by properly resetting state
- Streamline interruption response for faster processing
- Update .gitignore to exclude audio files from commits

This implementation ensures Nova captures what the user says during the
interruption itself, rather than waiting until after the interruption
is detected to start listening. The system now maintains a continuous
buffer of audio from the moment speech is first detected, providing a
more natural interruption experience.
