This commit completes the MVP phase of Hey Nova with several key improvements:

- Enhanced documentation across all core modules
- Fixed Whisper transcription generator issue
- Upgraded Whisper model from base to small for better accuracy
- Implemented streaming LLM and TTS responses
- Added comprehensive fallback mechanisms

- Added DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md with current status and roadmap

The assistant now features:
- Robust speech recognition with VAD state machine
