# Interruption Capability Status

## Current Implementation

We've implemented several approaches to enable interruption capability in Nova:

1. **Dedicated Interruption Monitor**
   - Created a standalone `InterruptionMonitor` class in `core/audio/interruption_monitor.py`
   - Uses PyAudio for direct audio monitoring
   - Implements adaptive baseline energy detection
   - Provides both real-time and background monitoring

2. **Enhanced TTS with Interruption Support**
   - Updated `SpeechSynthesizer` in `core/tts/speaker.py`
   - Added fallback to legacy interruption method
   - Implemented immediate speech stopping when interruption is detected

3. **Streamlined Main Flow**
   - Simplified interruption messaging in `core/main.py`
   - Delegated interruption handling to the speaker class

## Known Issues

Despite these implementations, the interruption capability is still not working reliably. Possible reasons:

1. **Audio Input/Output Conflict**: The system may be unable to reliably listen while speaking due to hardware/driver limitations.

2. **Echo Cancellation**: Without proper acoustic echo cancellation, the system might not be able to distinguish between its own output and user input.

3. **Timing Issues**: There might be delays in the audio processing pipeline affecting interruption detection.

4. **Resource Contention**: Multiple audio streams (TTS output and interruption monitoring) might be competing for resources.

## Next Steps

For our next session, we should consider:

1. **Debugging the Audio Pipeline**:
   - Add detailed logging of audio energy levels
   - Test with different audio parameters
   - Verify audio device configurations

2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Explore using a separate audio device for monitoring
   - Consider implementing a push-to-interrupt button
   - Research OS-specific audio APIs for better control

3. **Simplified Testing**:
   - Create isolated test scripts for interruption detection
   - Test with pre-recorded audio samples

4. **External Libraries**:
   - Investigate specialized libraries for acoustic echo cancellation
   - Look into WebRTC's full-duplex audio capabilities
