# 📊 Hey Nova Project Status

## 🎯 Current Status: MVP Structure Complete ✅

The Hey Nova project has been successfully set up with a complete MVP architecture that's ready for development and testing.

## 🏗️ What's Been Built

### ✅ Core Architecture
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Future-ready interfaces** that won't require rewrites
- **Comprehensive error handling** and fallback modes
- **Clean import structure** for easy development

### ✅ MVP Components
- **Wake Word Detection**: Porcupine integration with fallback to push-to-talk
- **Speech-to-Text**: Whisper integration with audio recording
- **Text-to-Speech**: macOS voice integration with configurable settings
- **Brain/Router**: Intelligent command routing (skills vs LLM)
- **Skills System**: App launching, system info, math, Notion stub
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with sensible defaults

### ✅ Development Tools
- **Setup Script**: Automated environment setup and dependency installation
- **Test Suite**: Basic functionality tests
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and quick start guide
- **Requirements**: All necessary dependencies specified

## 🚀 Ready to Run

The project is **immediately runnable** with these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Set API key**: Add OpenAI key to `.env` file
3. **Run Nova**: `python core/main.py`

## 🌌 Future Vision Architecture

The MVP is designed with these future features in mind:

### Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence
- Proactive greetings and context awareness
- Real Notion integration (currently stubbed)
- Memory and conversation history
- Habit learning and routine automation

### Phase 3: Multi-Device Support
- FastAPI server for cross-device communication
- WebSocket streaming for real-time audio
- Mobile app integration
- Cross-platform wake word detection

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Neural TTS (Azure, ElevenLabs)
- Home automation skills
- Background service (LaunchAgent)
- Security and encryption

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Modular Design
- Each component (`wakeword`, `stt`, `tts`, `brain`) is independent
- Clear interfaces between components
- Easy to test individual pieces
- Simple to extend with new capabilities

### Fallback Systems
- Wake word → push-to-talk fallback
- Audio → text input fallback
- TTS → console output fallback
- Skills → LLM fallback

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration
- Sensible defaults for all settings
- Easy to customize voice, audio, and LLM settings
- Future-ready for more complex configs
