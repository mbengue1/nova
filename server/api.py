"""
Hey Nova API Server (Future Feature)
Provides HTTP endpoints for multi-device Nova operation
"""
# This is a placeholder for future development
# It will contain FastAPI endpoints like:
# - POST /ask - Send text query to Nova
# - GET /stream - Stream audio responses
# - POST /memory - Store conversation context
# - GET /skills - List available skills

# For now, this file exists to show the intended architecture
# and prevent import errors in the current MVP
